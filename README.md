# Percentage Chance
Just a very simple script that computes the 'percentage chance' of jobs by dividng the number of available spots by the number of people currently applied to the job (with the addition of yourself to simulate an already complete application). This script is meant to help streamline your applications for the most interviews possible. 


It color codes the resulting percentages based their value, quantifying percentages <10 in red, percentages <30 in amber, and all other percentages in green. Feel free to change the tiers to different values, as they are only temporary.
